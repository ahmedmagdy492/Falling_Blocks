## Things Applied
- Applied some matrix transformation learned from previous game Asteroids specifically rotation but this time it's a little bit different since we should rotate around a center block not a center point
- First time to try shaders in any game
- Applied some of the things i learned in C++
- Created a tiny UI framework
